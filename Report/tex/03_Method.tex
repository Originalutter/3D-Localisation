	\subsection{Implementation}
		\subsubsection{Connecting the modules}
			The \gls{uwb} modules used in this project have a \gls{spi} that was used for communication with the Tmote Sky modules. Since the Tmote Sky does not have a dedicated \gls{spi} connection through extension pins it had to be connected in another way. In this project it was done as shown in Figure \ref{fig_Tmote_connections} where the $SPI\_MISO$ was connected to a point in the middle of the circuit board. This was achieved by carefully scraping the surface of the board to expose the copper and then cleaning the area with a flux pen before soldering.

		\subsubsection{Path loss formula}
		The model used to calculate the distance is derived from equation \ref{eq_rssidist} described in \cite{seidel_914_1992} where $\overline{PL}$ denotes mean path loss, $d_0$ denotes a reference distance, $d$ denotes the distance between the transmitter and the receiver and $n$ denotes the path loss exponent. 
		\begin{equation} \label{eq_rssidist}
			\overline{PL}(d) = PL(d_0) + 10 * n * log_{10}(\frac{d}{d_0})
		\end{equation}

		Oguejiofor proposes a model where $d_0$ is one meter and utilizes equation \ref{eq_rssidist} to derive equation \ref{eq_rssidist2} where $n$ is the path loss exponent, $RSSI$ is the received signal strength and $PL(d_0)$ is the path loss at the reference distance of one meter away from the transmitter \cite{oguejiofor_trilateration_2013}. 
		\begin{equation} \label{eq_rssidist2}
			d = 10^{\frac{PL(d_0)-RSSI}{n*10}}
		\end{equation}

		Equation \ref{eq_plexp} was used to determine the value of the path loss exponent, $n$, using $M$ measurements as proposed by Oguejiofor \cite{oguejiofor_trilateration_2013}.
		\begin{equation} \label{eq_plexp}
			n = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{M}[PL(d_i)-PL(d_0)]}{\sum_{i=1}^{M}[10*log_{10}(d_i)]}
		\end{equation}

		\subsubsection{Polynomial curve fitting}
		Using the path loss formula yielded no satisfying results and therefore another method using polynomial curve fitting was tested. The following measurements were made for applying polynomial curve fitting.

		\begin{table}[H]
			\centering
			\caption{Recorded RSSI values at different distances}
			\label{tbl_dist}
			\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
				\hline
				{\bf Distance in metres} & {\bf RSSI loss in dB} \\ \hline
				1              & 11         \\
				2              & 13         \\
				3              & 15         \\
				4              & 16         \\
				5              & 18        	\\
				6              & 20    		\\
				7              & 21       	\\
				8              & 23         \\
				9              & 25         \\
				10             & 27         \\ \hline
			\end{tabular} 				
		\end{table}
			In order to find a polynomial function of degree $3$ to approximate the distance between two nodes by using the RSSI loss values, the RSSI loss values was saved as $X$ and the distances was saved as $Y$, the MATLAB function $polyfit$ was used as shown below.

			\begin{verbatim}
				polyfit(x,y,3)
			\end{verbatim}

			The result of the call to $polyfit$ was used to define the approximative distance function given by equation \ref{eq_approxdist}, where $x$ is the path loss expressed in dB.

			\begin{equation}\label{eq_approxdist}
				Distance = -8.1446*10^{-4}x^3 + 4.4385*10^-2x^2 - 0.18979x - 1.2203
			\end{equation}

			The obtained approximative function looked promising when comparing it to the measured distances in the range of 1 to 10 metres as shown in Figure \ref{fig_polyfit_plot}.
